*touch for a Windows path.*

## About

This repository is **File Touch Now**, a desktop utility. touch for a Windows path.

A build step wants mtime now. Notepad changes the content.

Point it at a path, preview the plan if you want, then write the result next to the source or to `--out`.

## What's included

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.
